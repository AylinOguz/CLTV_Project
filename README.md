# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction with BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma Models

This project aims to calculate and predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) of FLO's customers using probabilistic models. By understanding how much revenue a customer is likely to generate over a specific time period, businesses can make more informed marketing and customer retention decisions.

## üîç Project Overview

- Data Source: OmniChannel customer transaction data from 2020‚Äì2021.
- Objective: Estimate the potential future value of existing customers.
- Models Used: 
  - **BG/NBD** (Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution) for purchase frequency prediction.
  - **Gamma-Gamma** for monetary value prediction.

## üìä Key Steps

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Feature engineering (Recency, Frequency, T, Monetary)  
- Model fitting and CLTV calculation  
- Segmentation based on predicted CLTV

## üí° What You Can Learn

- How to build customer lifetime value models
- How to work with transactional customer data
- Real-world application of probabilistic modeling
